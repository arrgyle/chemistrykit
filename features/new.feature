# Disabling for now, not sure if we need to keep this
#Feature: ckit new
#
#  Run "ckit new <project_name>" to generate a new ChemistryKit project.
#
#  Background: Running ckit new
#    When I run `ckit new booker`
#
#  @announce
#  Scenario: Project directory is created
#    Then I should see a project with the following structure:
#    # └── booker
#    # ├── _config
#    # │   ├── chemistrykit.yaml
#    # │   ├── requires.rb
#    # │   └── saucelabs.yaml.example
#    # ├── beakers
#    # ├── evidence
#    # └── formulas
#
#  Scenario: Project name is inserted in configs
#    Then "Booker" is set as the project name
